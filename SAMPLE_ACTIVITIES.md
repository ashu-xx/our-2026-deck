## Tips for Adding Activities:

### Photo Suggestions:
- For 2025 memories: Use actual photos from your experiences
- For 2026 plans: Use placeholder images or aspirational photos
- Keep images landscape orientation (300x200 works well)
- Compress images before upload for faster loading

### Writing Descriptions:
- Keep descriptions short (2-3 sentences max)
- Add personal touches or inside jokes
- Include practical details (best season, booking needed, etc.)
- Make it exciting and romantic!

### Week Number Assignment:
- Consider seasonality (outdoor activities in summer, cozy ones in winter)
- Spread expensive activities throughout the year
- Group related activities (e.g., multiple garden visits in spring)
- Leave some flexibility for spontaneous swaps

### Balancing the Suits:
- You have 13 cards per suit (like a real deck!)
- Make sure each quarter of the year has a mix of all categories
- Don't cluster all outdoor activities in summer
- Balance high-energy and low-energy activities

**Remember**: These are just suggestions! Customize them based on:
- Your actual interests and hobbies
- Your budget and time constraints
- London's seasonal events and weather
- Your work schedules and commitments
